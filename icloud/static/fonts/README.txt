Satsuyako first released the kana font Cherry Bomb in 2012 with the concept, "Cute with a kick." Its round and modern bounciness has made it appealing for diverse use, ranging from title logos and food packaging to children's magazines.

For the Google Fonts version, the designer has adjusted the outline and balance of all the letters, added symbols and Latin glyphs, and made it into a proportional font that could also be used in the vertical writing style.
